# Quantum Chess

Quantum Chess is a chess variant where each piece has a quantum amplitude, allowing for probabilistic moves, splitting, and amplification.

## Features

- Standard chess rules, but no checks or checkmates.
- Pieces have amplitudes (complex numbers) representing their probability of being selected.
- Pieces can split, creating identical pieces with half the amplitude.
- Amplification increases a piece's amplitude after multiple splits.
- Play against another human or an AI.

## Gameplay

- **Move pieces** by clicking and dragging.
- **Split** a piece after moving, creating a quantum superposition.
- **Amplify** a piece after it has been split at least twice.
- **Win** by capturing the opponent's king.

## Setup

1. **Requirements**:
    - Java 24
    - IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE

2. **Clone the repository**:

3. **Run the game**:
    - Open the project in your IDE.
    - Run `src/main/Main.java`.
